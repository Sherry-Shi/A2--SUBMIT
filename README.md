# Online-Retail-Database-system

1.design and implement an end-to-end java application that queries a relational database


2. assume you are expected to support a real online retailer with large number of users. 
At scale, running queries on a single machine is unacceptably slow and impractical. 
As an alternative to address the aforementioned efficiency problem, with this assignment you will develop sample queries in MapReduce to be executed on top of a cloud computing system (namely, Amazon EC2), which allows parallel computation for efficient execution of queries at large scale (Part I). 
Once you develop these queries, you will also evaluate and report on their performance as the number of machines allocated to execute the queries grow (Part II).
